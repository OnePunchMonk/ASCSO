## Abstract

Inspired by sand cat hunting strategies, the Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm has gained recogni-
tion for its effectiveness in optimization tasks, particularly in its ability to exploit promising areas in the search space.
Similar to many metaheuristic algorithms, SCSO can sometimes struggle to escape local optima. To address this limi-
tation, we propose the Adaptive Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (Adaptive SCSO) algorithm, which introduces several
enhancements aimed at improving both exploration and exploitation. Key modifications include an adaptive step-size
control mechanism that progressively reduces the step size over iterations, promoting greater exploitation in later op-
timization stages. Additionally, an enhanced selection process using tournament selection was introduced to identify
a set of leaders, further improving solution refinement. The algorithm features a dynamic hunter-follower strategy, in
which agents alternate between exploration (hunters) and exploitation (followers), ensuring a balanced search. Tar-
geted random walks are applied to potentially stuck solutions, either exploitation-oriented or diversification-oriented.
